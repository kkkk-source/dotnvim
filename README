This repository is vim config file
==================================

I'm looking for a good configuration that make me feel like I can fly over my 
keyboard with vim, whereas I save the history of all the changes that I make.

Archives organization
=====================

All the *.vim files into plugin folder is automatically sourced. That is the 
reason vim-plug is into init.vim, it is a plugin managament; it have to be 
primarily loaded. Thereby it's completly safe to put all the plugins files 
configuration into plugin folder. See commit 5564a18.

plugin: in here I put all the plugins files configuration.
plugin/own: in here I put all my own changes, e.g., my own keybinds, my own 
colorscheme changes or my own "plugins" like latex (nonetheless latex isn't 
a plugin, it only has two lines of code, but works very well for me).
